# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars
## Objective

The purpose of the Homework was to build a Full Stack Application. 
1. The first part of this homework was to use Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinters to build different dictionaries by scraping websites for Mars Data. This included Mars images and table of information.
2. The second part of this assignment was to create a MongoDB Database.
3. After creating a MongoDB, it was time to create a Flask Application. This Flask Application turned the webscraping material into dictionaries so that the HTML script could read and publish all information related to Mars.

For specific information about the assignment, please read below:


## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) to collect the latest news and paragraph text on Mars. This was achieved through BeautifulSoup and Splinter through Pandas in Jupyter Notebook.

```python
# Example:
news_title = "NASA's Next Mars Mission to Investigate Interior of Red Planet"

news_p = "Preparation of NASA's next spacecraft to Mars, InSight, has ramped up this summer, on course for launch next May from Vandenberg Air Force Base in central California -- the first interplanetary launch in history from America's West Coast."
```

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* [JPL Featured Space Image](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars) to collect the feature images of Mars.

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

```python
# Example:
featured_image_url = 'https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/images/largesize/PIA16225_hires.jpg'
```

### Mars Facts

* [Mars Facts webpage] (https://space-facts.com/mars/) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.

* Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

## Step 3 - Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.

2. Screenshots of your final application.

3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.

## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
